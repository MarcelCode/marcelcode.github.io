# About Me

- Proudly working as Innovation Team Lead at EOMAP
- Still like to code and prototype to try out newest innovations in the geospatial world
- I love to combine model geospatial technologies like COG, PmTiles, STAC with a modern serverless clud architecture
- A big fan of not reinventing the wheel and combining existing open-source solutions to create someting new
- Specializing in geospatial software engineering and cloud-native architecture
- Building innovative spatial solutions with Python, AWS, and cloud-native technologies 



Some text from an application. Remove the new company but take the text as input for the about me section:

My technical expertise in geospatial software engineering and enthusiasm for sports make me an ideal candidate for this role.
My career has been driven by a passion for geospatial innovation and thinking outside the box. In 2020, my university team and
I won Europe’s largest IoT Hackathon by BOSCH in the Tech4Climate category. This was followed by a significant achievement in
2022 when I won the Copernicus Masters Frontier Tech Challenge by the European Space Agency. I developed RastLess, a serverless
cloud solution for visualizing and analyzing spatio‑temporal raster data, which is now used in production at EOMAP, reducing service
cloud costs by over 95%.
At EOMAP, I play a crucial role in the company’s growth and success. Starting as a Junior Backend Engineer, I contributed sig‑
nificantly to expanding our team from two to ten software engineers. My dedication and leadership were recognized when I was
promoted to Innovation Team Lead in 2023. I have ensured clear responsibilities and effective collaboration within the team, driving the de‑
velopment of innovative solutions that have substantially contributed to EOMAP’s success.
In my professional role, I have scaled satellite processing pipelines from local systems to cloud environments using AWS technolo‑
gies, processing hundreds of satellite scenes in parallel. I implemented microservice architectures with several API services using
Python and geospatial libraries like GDAL and Rasterio. Additionally, I developed a serverless tile server for Sentinel‑2 satellite
scenes in Go, optimized for performance and cost efficiency.
I am eager to bring my geospatial software engineering skills to Strava and contribute to a platform that inspires and connects
athletes worldwide. I am passionate about integrating cutting‑edge cloud technologies with geospatial data and constantly seeking
new technological advancements to enhance my expertise.


I am an experienced Geospatial Software Engineer and Team Lead at EOMAP with over eight years in geospatial and cloud technologies. Passionate
about integrating cutting‑edge cloud technologies with geospatial data, I constantly seek new advancements to enhance my expertise. I specialize
in implementing serverless microservice architectures with API backends in Python and Go.
